# Sample Project

A small CLI tool for demonstrating a well documented README.

## Installation

```bash
pip install sample-project
```

## Usage

```bash
sample-project --help
```

## Troubleshooting

If you see an import error, confirm you are using Python 3.9+ and a fresh virtual environment.

## Limitations

This example README does not document a real tool, and it omits advanced configuration.

## Contributing
